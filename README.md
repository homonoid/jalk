# Jalk

Jalk is yet another calculator of mine. It is a companion to Mycalk, the first of my calculator tries. This thing works pretty similarly to it, with comparable (as to my eye) speed and code quality.

### TL; DR

Handwritten parsers and lexers are very flexible, yet too long to write, or so I think. They have their pros and their cons, as everything else in this world. I am more familiar with parser generators and I was even more familiar with them in the past, so it's my process of *re-learning* what has lead to creating of this repository and of this project. 

### Running

`git clone` this repository, type `chmod +x bin/jalk`, then `bin/jalk`, and PROFIT! If you have any problems, notify me somehow about them, and I will try to fix them.
